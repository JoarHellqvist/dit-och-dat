# Project Overview - Golf log / scorecard

The purpose of the project is to develop a simple application to log golf play / scores, with a low barrier for players.

When playing golf, it is necessary to keep track of the score, traditionally this is done with pen and paper. Most people already have some form of smartphone available and a simple application is well suited for casual players. The application aims to replace pen and paper. Further, it allows the player to both keep track of each shot and automatically calculate the final score. The purpose is to make the golfing experience more convenient.

Currently there are similar applications, but many do require you to register with an official Golf-ID which can only be obtained by paying golf club membership fees and by achieving an “official handicap”, which beginners may lack, or they provide very complicated functionality which may be off-putting for casual players, such as advanced statistics of how each shot derailed etc.

In our app, there will be no need for registering with a Golf-ID and as such, a player can use the app immediately. It aims to be simple and easy to use, thus only displaying the most vital information and features necessary to play a casual game of golf.

We have two different stakeholders that are friends to the group. Both of which play golf regularly on a casual level.

# Scope

The primary goal is to develop a minimum viable product, scorekeeping application with good user experience. Additional features may be added if resources allow it, such as range finding using Google Maps API, or the support of wearables, but the additional features must be directly relevant to end user’s needs.

# Benefits and Costs

This project is meant to be a non-profit project.

The only costs are the time spent on project related work, application development and writing of our final report.

# Implementation Method

We will build an Android application using Android Studio.

Timeline The development cycle will consist of 1-week sprints, spanning a total of 7 weeks.

# Expected Outcomes

A simple golf-log application for Android that fulfils basic user needs with possibilities for further improvements by adding new features. Thoroughly revised and detailed report on the development process.
