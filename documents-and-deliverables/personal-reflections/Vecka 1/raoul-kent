  I want to gain more refined knowledge knowledge of the practical implementation of scrum.
  Both in terms of the roles and workflow.

-How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  Since I have some preparatory knowledge I hope some of it can come to use in getting up to speed quick.
And maybe if it's needed I can help out with git for version control!

  As of yet we haven't started implementing scrum, but I have taken the time
  to pose questions around how we wish to synchronize and communicate effectively.

  Editing parts of the group contract and finding two product ideas.
