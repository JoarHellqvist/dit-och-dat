What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to deepen my knowledge for the most commonly used classes in AS. I further want to get better 
and faster at debugging the code I write.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since I over tha past week have deepen my knowledge around AS I will maybe be able to help someone 
else learn something new. Though, there are other group members that are a lot more skilled than I am 
and that have been very happy to help the group with tips and tricks.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
For the past week I've done my part of the work the team set out that every member should do. 
That was to learn AS and to understand GitHub. With the knowledge that I've gathered, I will be able 
to further contribute during the upcoming sprints. 


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
During the past week, I have spent a lot of time learning the basics of Android Studio. It was 
challenging in the beginning but after hours on youtube and stackoverflow I finally felt my old 
Java knowledge coming back while my AS skills grew. At the end of the day, I have realized how fun 
it is to code in an IDE like AS. With my new exitment and skills I will be able to contribute during 
the sprints.
