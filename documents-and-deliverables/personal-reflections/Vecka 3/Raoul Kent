- What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn to use Scrum in practice, especially meeting structure and work division.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I'll be happy to assist with anything, if anyone have questions or whatever.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We chose not to divide tasks and stories this week since there was little time left over due to easter.
Instead we each had the task to look at building a small test application in Android to get everyone up to speed.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I completed my test application after a redo.
