- What do I want to learn or understand better?
For the next week I want to learn to use Scrum in practice.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I'll be happy to assist with anything, if anyone have questions or whatever.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We didn't use scrum this week since it's a re-exam week and easter, so we instead choose to learn Android individually.
I came up with a very simple Android App that everyone in the group should do to practice their skills.
The app involves making very basic Android specific things since everyone already knows Java.
(Such as making a button that updates the UI and another button to switch between activities.)
Our first sprint starts the upcoming week.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Completed the individual test-app that we all agreed to do, set up my Android environment etc.
Provided feedback on teammates test-app.
