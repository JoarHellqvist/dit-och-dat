## What do I want to learn or understand better?
We have decided to produce an Android application, so I am looking forward to learning more about the technics of it.
Additionally I am looking to learn more about how to efficiently work with scrum to organize my own workflow in unison with the team.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
My knowledge within Java may come to be useful in helping others in the Team.
Additionally there seems to be a greater knowledge gap surrounding how to use git as a VCS, so that's somewhere I can help early on.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have participated actively in creating job-stories and been an active participant in all morning meetings this week

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have written most of the project description and submitted relevant deliverables.
