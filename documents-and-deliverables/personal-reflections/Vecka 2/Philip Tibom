- What do I want to learn or understand better?
We've decided to develop an app for Android, thus I want to learn more about Android specific programming.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have some limited experience with Android from before and we all have very limited time to learn Android programming.
So I can help by steering the group towards learning the most essential parts (ie, XML/UI, Intents and such), since everyone
already knows Java programming. I can also answer basic questions if anyone gets stuck in the learning process.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Helped creating job-stories, sent questions to teacher on group's behalf about implemetation of scrum.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Came up with project ideas (others did too) and we all voted.
Gave feedback on the mockup, helped writing the product description and scope.
