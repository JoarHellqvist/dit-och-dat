What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to develop my knowledge around scrum and further my skills regarding app development. 
Further I will strive to get a comprehensive understanding for the different kinds of tools available regarding version handling, 
team communication and other software integrations used during software development. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
The fact that our team consist of persons from different programs is something that believe will lead to a great learning experience. 
Hopefully I will be able to help someone learn something new based on my experiences from my own program, 
like I certainly will learn from the other student in my group about topics I haven’t encountered before. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Personally, I’ve had a lot of other obligations outside this course during this first week and not been able to make the kind of contributions that I would have liked. 
I will spend time to read about scrum and make myself able to give a solid contribution. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Like I said on the previous question, I haven’t been able to spend as much time on the course as I would have liked to. 
I look forward to taking more responsibility regarding the work in progress and the planning.
