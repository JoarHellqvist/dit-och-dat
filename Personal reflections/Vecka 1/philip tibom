- What do I want to learn or understand better?
I already have a little bit of experience with scrum as I've used it in other projects,
but I would like to learn it properly/fully in this course. We also haven't decided upon a project idea yet so I plan
to do some research in the coming days.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can contribute with the limited experience that I already have of scrum, to hopefully accelerate the understanding of it
for other group members. I have good programming experience and will be happy to assist anyone in need.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We didn't start working with scrum yet. But I've already prepared a scrum-board on Trello for the group, with assistance from Raoul.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Discussed together with group what to include in the social contract. We also discussed some project ideas.
